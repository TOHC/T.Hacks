                        <h2>What is a hackathon?</h2>
						<p>Simply put, a hackathon is an "innovation and invention marathon". Anyone interested in design and technology attend hackathons to learn, build and share
						their creations in a relaxed and welcoming environment over the course of one weekend. Programming experience is absolutely not required - but a drive
						to learn and create is!</p>
                        <h2>What if I don’t know how to code?</h2>
						<p>Not a problem! It’s entirely irrelevant what your experience is going into a hackathon, it’s more about your interest in technology. If you’re wanting to learn how to code outside of a hackathon, try places such as Codeacademy, DMOJ or look for Scotch.io tutorials.</p>
						<h2>What should I bring?</h2>
						<p>Be sure to bring your laptop, chargers, comfortable clothing and a drive to learn! We suggest bringing a sleeping bag, deodorant and toothbrush/toothpaste.</p>
						<h2>Will there be food?</h2>
						<p>Absolutely! Your meals for the weekend will be free and there’ll be plenty of snacks and drinks to keep you energized. If you’ve got specific dietary requirements, let us know and we'll make arrangements.</p>
						<h2>Will there be travel reimbursements?</h2>
						<p>Unfortunately, the Toronto Hacker Club isn’t able to provide hackers with travel reimbursements.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col">
                        <h2>What if I don’t know anybody there?</h2>
						<p>Not to worry! You’ll meet people when you get there. Everybody’s very friendly. A lot of people go to hackathons without teams. So it’s perfectly normal to go around to people, tell them you’re looking for a team, and ask if you can help out. Hackathons will often run team-matching sessions at the start to help you meet people. And you can often join a facebook group for the event beforehand and post there to find potential teammates.</p>
                        <h2>What if I don’t have an idea?</h2>
						<p>That’s normal. Most people don’t have an idea before they get to the event. But once you start talking to other people, you might come up with something. You can also work with somebody else on their idea if you like it. And there will be prizes at the event which might help give you some ideas. Don’t worry about it, you’ll find something to work on.</p>
						<h2>What if I don’t want to present?</h2>
						<p>You might think your project isn’t impressive or it might not be finished so you don’t want to present it. You should present it anyway! Honestly, hackathons isn’t about being the best or being competitive. It’s all about having fun, making friends and learning how to become better at things you care about. Presenting your hack gives you a chance to be proud of what you’ve done, and you should be proud.</p>
						<h2>What if my question wasn't answered?</h2>
						<p>Send us an email at <a href="mailto:contact@torontohacker.club">contact@torontohacker.club</a> or send us a message on Facebook and we will get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
